<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>







<p>This file contains multiple implimentations of LSD (least
significant digit) radix sort. Radix sort sorts values based off of
each byte. No comparisons are used, so this algorithm runs in linear
time. The MSD radix sort is not implemented because it can easily.
Radix sort's advantages are more easily seen for items with a large
number of bytes, becuase it does not compare bytes that it knows to be
already sorted, unlike quicksort. A good example, taken from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Algorithms in C++</span>,
by Robert Sedgewick, is to consider the hex values
abcdefee,&nbsp;abcdefgg,&nbsp;abcdefhh,&nbsp;abcdefjj,&nbsp;abcdefkk,
and&nbsp;abcdefll.
Even though the first six characters of each string are the same,
quicksort will still examine them all, while radix sort will quickly
figure out that the strings were already sorted up to the sixth
character, and then sort only the seventh and eigth. In addition, there
is are versions of radix sort optimized for each of the native values.
Finally, radix sort does much less compares than other sort, so it
interferes with processor pipelining much less. However, radix sort
does have some disadvantages. The object must define operator[] to
return a char or must be garrunteed not to return a value higher than
255. In addition, if operator[] is complex, it will severly slow down
the algorithm. Also, radix sort is slightly harder to implement for items
of variable length, although it can be done in an optimized manner.
See <a href="Optimizing%20Radixsort.html">Optimizing RadixSort</a>.
Unfortunantly, although it is possible to sort individual floats, it is
nearly impossible to implement a fast way to extract bytes from
floating point values that will work for objects containing floats
becuase of the way that bytes are extracted, and&nbsp;quicksort or
mergesort should be used instead.</p>

BOOST_USE_SSE<br>



To use the SSE interface, define this. It increases the speed of the
float sorting function greatly. The compiler must have the header <span style="font-family: monospace;">defined by <a href="#boost_sse">BOOST_SSE_INCLUDE_FILE</a> </span>and
the cpu must support SSE instructions. If
you do not plan to sort floats using radix sort, do not define
BOOST_USE_SSE<br>
<br>
<a name="boost_sse"></a>BOOST_SSE_INCLUDE_FILE<br>
This is the file to be include that contains sse instructions. The default is xmmintrin.h<br>

  <dt><b>Requires:</b> That for any object t of class T, t must be an integral type (excluding double) or t[num] must be defined.</dt>

  <dt><b>Complexity:</b> O(k*n),
&nbsp;where k is the
number of bytes, n is the number of elements. Byte sizes of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 are preferred.</dt>
  <dt><b>Rationale:</b> The function might appear to have many
extra variables and pointers, but they speed up the function becuase
they can be stored in a high-speed register, while normal memory can't.
In addition, register variables&nbsp;allow more cache hits.</dt>
